bippy is a toolkit to **hack into react internals**

by default, you cannot access react internals. bippy bypasses this by "pretending" to be react devtools, giving you access to the fiber tree and other internals.

- works outside of react – no react code modification needed
- utility functions that work across modern react (v17-19)
- no prior react source code knowledge required

```jsx
import { onCommitFiberRoot, traverseFiber } from 'bippy';

onCommitFiberRoot((root) => {
  traverseFiber(root.current, (fiber) => {
    // prints every fiber in the current React tree
    console.log('fiber:', fiber);
  });
});
```

## how it works & motivation

bippy allows you to **access** and **use** react fibers **outside** of react components.

a react fiber is a "unit of execution." this means react will do something based on the data in a fiber. each fiber either represents a composite (function/class component) or a host (dom element).

> here is a [live visualization](https://jser.pro/ddir/rie?reactVersion=18.3.1&snippetKey=hq8jm2ylzb9u8eh468) of what the fiber tree looks like, and here is a [deep dive article](https://jser.dev/2023-07-18-how-react-rerenders/).

fibers are useful because they contain information about the react app (component props, state, contexts, etc.). a simplified version of a fiber looks roughly like this:

```typescript
interface Fiber {
  // component type (function/class)
  type: any;

  child: Fiber | null;
  sibling: Fiber | null;

  // stateNode is the host fiber (e.g. DOM element)
  stateNode: Node | null;

  // parent fiber
  return: Fiber | null;

  // the previous or current version of the fiber
  alternate: Fiber | null;

  // saved props input
  memoizedProps: any;

  // state (useState, useReducer, useSES, etc.)
  memoizedState: any;

  // contexts (useContext)
  dependencies: Dependencies | null;

  // effects (useEffect, useLayoutEffect, etc.)
  updateQueue: any;
}
```

here, the `child`, `sibling`, and `return` properties are pointers to other fibers in the tree.

additionally, `memoizedProps`, `memoizedState`, and `dependencies` are the fiber's props, state, and contexts.

while all of the information is there, it's not super easy to work with, and changes frequently across different versions of react. bippy simplifies this by providing utility functions like:

- `traverseRenderedFibers` to detect renders and `traverseFiber` to traverse the overall fiber tree
  - _(instead of `child`, `sibling`, and `return` pointers)_
- `traverseProps`, `traverseState`, and `traverseContexts` to traverse the fiber's props, state, and contexts
  - _(instead of `memoizedProps`, `memoizedState`, and `dependencies`)_

however, fibers aren't directly accessible by the user. so, we have to hack our way around to accessing it.

luckily, react [reads from a property](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/6a4b46cd70d2672bc4be59dcb5b8dede22ed0cef/packages/react-reconciler/src/reactFiberDevToolsHook.js#L48) in the window object: `window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` and runs handlers on it when certain events happen. this property must exist before react's bundle is executed. this is intended for react devtools, but we can use it to our advantage.

here's what it roughly looks like:

```typescript
interface __REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__ {
  // list of renderers (react-dom, react-native, etc.)
  renderers: Map<RendererID, reactRenderer>;

  // called when react has rendered everything for an update and the fiber tree is fully built and ready to
  // apply changes to the host tree (e.g. DOM mutations)
  onCommitFiberRoot: (
    rendererID: RendererID,
    root: FiberRoot,
    commitPriority?: number
  ) => void;

  // called when effects run
  onPostCommitFiberRoot: (rendererID: RendererID, root: FiberRoot) => void;

  // called when a specific fiber unmounts
  onCommitFiberUnmount: (rendererID: RendererID, fiber: Fiber) => void;
}
```

bippy works by monkey-patching `window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` with our own custom handlers. bippy simplifies this by providing utility functions like:

- `instrument` to safely patch `window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__`
  - _(instead of directly mutating `onCommitFiberRoot`, ...)_
- `secure` to wrap your handlers in a try/catch and determine if handlers are safe to run
  - _(instead of rawdogging `window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` handlers, which may crash your app)_
- `traverseRenderedFibers` to traverse the fiber tree and determine which fibers have actually rendered
  - _(instead of `child`, `sibling`, and `return` pointers)_
- `traverseFiber` to traverse the fiber tree, regardless of whether it has rendered
  - _(instead of `child`, `sibling`, and `return` pointers)_
- `setFiberId` / `getFiberId` to set and get a fiber's id
  - _(instead of anonymous fibers with no identity)_

## how to use

you can either install via a npm (recommended) or a script tag.

this package should be imported before a React app runs. this will add a special object to the global which is used by React for providing its internals to the tool for analysis (React Devtools does the same). as soon as React library is loaded and attached to the tool, bippy starts collecting data about what is going on in React's internals.

```shell
npm install bippy
```

or, use via script tag:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/bippy"></script>
```

> this will cause bippy to be accessible under a `window.Bippy` global.

next, you can use the api to get data about the fiber tree. below is a (useful) subset of the api. for the full api, read the [source code](https://github.com/aidenybai/bippy/blob/main/src/core.ts).

### onCommitFiberRoot

a utility function that wraps the `instrument` function and sets the `onCommitFiberRoot` hook.

```typescript
import { onCommitFiberRoot } from 'bippy';

onCommitFiberRoot((root) => {
  console.log('root ready to commit', root);
});
```

### instrument

> the underlying implementation for the `onCommitFiberRoot()` function. this is optional, unless you want to plug into more less common, advanced functionality.

patches `window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` with your handlers. must be imported before react, and must be initialized to properly run any other methods.

> use with the `secure` function to prevent uncaught errors from crashing your app.

```typescript
import { instrument, secure } from 'bippy'; // must be imported BEFORE react
import * as React from 'react';

instrument(
  secure({
    onCommitFiberRoot(rendererID, root) {
      console.log('root ready to commit', root);
    },
    onPostCommitFiberRoot(rendererID, root) {
      console.log('root with effects committed', root);
    },
    onCommitFiberUnmount(rendererID, fiber) {
      console.log('fiber unmounted', fiber);
    },
  })
);
```

### getRDTHook

returns the `window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` object. great for advanced use cases, such as accessing or modifying the `renderers` property.

```typescript
import { getRDTHook } from 'bippy';

const hook = getRDTHook();
console.log(hook);
```

### traverseRenderedFibers

not every fiber in the fiber tree renders. `traverseRenderedFibers` allows you to traverse the fiber tree and determine which fibers have actually rendered.

```typescript
import { instrument, secure, traverseRenderedFibers } from 'bippy'; // must be imported BEFORE react
import * as React from 'react';

instrument(
  secure({
    onCommitFiberRoot(rendererID, root) {
      traverseRenderedFibers(root, (fiber) => {
        console.log('fiber rendered', fiber);
      });
    },
  })
);
```

### traverseFiber

calls a callback on every fiber in the fiber tree.

```typescript
import { instrument, secure, traverseFiber } from 'bippy'; // must be imported BEFORE react
import * as React from 'react';

instrument(
  secure({
    onCommitFiberRoot(rendererID, root) {
      traverseFiber(root.current, (fiber) => {
        console.log(fiber);
      });
    },
  })
);
```

### traverseProps

traverses the props of a fiber.

```typescript
import { traverseProps } from 'bippy';

// ...

traverseProps(fiber, (propName, next, prev) => {
  console.log(propName, next, prev);
});
```

### traverseState

traverses the state (useState, useReducer, etc.) and effects that set state of a fiber.

```typescript
import { traverseState } from 'bippy';

// ...

traverseState(fiber, (next, prev) => {
  console.log(next, prev);
});
```

### traverseContexts

traverses the contexts (useContext) of a fiber.

```typescript
import { traverseContexts } from 'bippy';

// ...

traverseContexts(fiber, (next, prev) => {
  console.log(next, prev);
});
```

### setFiberId / getFiberId

set and get a persistent identity for a fiber. by default, fibers are anonymous and have no identity.

```typescript
import { setFiberId, getFiberId } from 'bippy';

// ...

setFiberId(fiber);
console.log('unique id for fiber:', getFiberId(fiber));
```

### isHostFiber

returns `true` if the fiber is a host fiber (e.g., a DOM node in react-dom).

```typescript
import { isHostFiber } from 'bippy';

if (isHostFiber(fiber)) {
  console.log('fiber is a host fiber');
}
```

### isCompositeFiber

returns `true` if the fiber is a composite fiber. composite fibers represent class components, function components, memoized components, and so on (anything that can actually render output).

```typescript
import { isCompositeFiber } from 'bippy';

if (isCompositeFiber(fiber)) {
  console.log('fiber is a composite fiber');
}
```

### getDisplayName

returns the display name of the fiber's component, falling back to the component's function or class name if available.

```typescript
import { getDisplayName } from 'bippy';

console.log(getDisplayName(fiber));
```

### getType

returns the underlying type (the component definition) for a given fiber. for example, this could be a function component or class component.

```jsx
import { getType } from 'bippy';
import { memo } from 'react';

const RealComponent = () => {
  return <div>hello</div>;
};
const MemoizedComponent = memo(() => {
  return <div>hello</div>;
});

console.log(getType(fiberForMemoizedComponent) === RealComponent);
```

### getNearestHostFiber / getNearestHostFibers

getNearestHostFiber returns the closest host fiber above or below a given fiber. getNearestHostFibers(fiber) returns all host fibers associated with the provided fiber and its subtree.

```jsx
import { getNearestHostFiber, getNearestHostFibers } from 'bippy';

// ...

function Component() {
  return (
    <>
      <div>hello</div>
      <div>world</div>
    </>
  );
}

console.log(getNearestHostFiber(fiberForComponent)); // <div>hello</div>
console.log(getNearestHostFibers(fiberForComponent)); // [<div>hello</div>, <div>world</div>]
```

### getTimings

returns the self and total render times for the fiber.

```typescript
// timings don't exist in react production builds
if (fiber.actualDuration !== undefined) {
  const { selfTime, totalTime } = getTimings(fiber);
  console.log(selfTime, totalTime);
}
```

### getFiberStack

returns an array representing the stack of fibers from the current fiber up to the root.

```typescript
[fiber, fiber.return, fiber.return.return, ...]
```

### getMutatedHostFibers

returns an array of all host fibers that have committed and rendered in the provided fiber's subtree.

```typescript
import { getMutatedHostFibers } from 'bippy';

console.log(getMutatedHostFibers(fiber));
```

### isValidFiber

returns `true` if the given object is a valid React Fiber (i.e., has a tag, stateNode, return, child, sibling, etc.).

```typescript
import { isValidFiber } from 'bippy';

console.log(isValidFiber(fiber));
```

## getFiberFromHostInstance

returns the fiber associated with a given host instance (e.g., a DOM element).

```typescript
import { getFiberFromHostInstance } from 'bippy';

const fiber = getFiberFromHostInstance(document.querySelector('div'));
console.log(fiber);
```

## getLatestFiber

returns the latest fiber (since it may be double-buffered). usually use this in combination with `getFiberFromHostInstance`.

```typescript
import { getLatestFiber } from 'bippy';

const latestFiber = getLatestFiber(
  getFiberFromHostInstance(document.querySelector('div'))
);
console.log(latestFiber);
```

## examples

the best way to understand bippy is to [read the source code](https://github.com/aidenybai/bippy/blob/main/src/core.ts). here are some examples of how you can use it:

### a mini react-scan

here's a mini toy version of [`react-scan`](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan) that highlights renders in your app.

```javascript
import {
  instrument,
  isHostFiber,
  getNearestHostFiber,
  traverseRenderedFibers,
} from 'bippy'; // must be imported BEFORE react

const highlightFiber = (fiber) => {
  if (!(fiber.stateNode instanceof HTMLElement)) return;
  // fiber.stateNode is a DOM element
  const rect = fiber.stateNode.getBoundingClientRect();
  const highlight = document.createElement('div');
  highlight.style.border = '1px solid red';
  highlight.style.position = 'fixed';
  highlight.style.top = `${rect.top}px`;
  highlight.style.left = `${rect.left}px`;
  highlight.style.width = `${rect.width}px`;
  highlight.style.height = `${rect.height}px`;
  highlight.style.zIndex = 999999999;
  document.documentElement.appendChild(highlight);
  setTimeout(() => {
    document.documentElement.removeChild(highlight);
  }, 100);
};

       */

         */
        const hostFiber = getNearestHostFiber(fiber);
        highlightFiber(hostFiber);
      });
    },
  })
);
```

### a mini why-did-you-render

here's a mini toy version of [`why-did-you-render`](https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render) that logs why components re-render.

## glossary

- fiber: a "unit of execution" in react, representing a component or dom element
- commit: the process of applying changes to the host tree (e.g. DOM mutations)
- render: the process of building the fiber tree by executing component function/classes
- host tree: the tree of UI elements that react mutates (e.g. DOM elements)
- reconciler (or "renderer"): custom bindings for react, e.g. react-dom, react-native, react-three-fiber, etc to mutate the host tree
- `rendererID`: the id of the reconciler, starting at 1 (can be from multiple reconciler instances)
- `root`: a special `FiberRoot` type that contains the container fiber (the one you pass to `ReactDOM.createRoot`) in the `current` property
- `onCommitFiberRoot`: called when react is ready to commit a fiber root
- `onPostCommitFiberRoot`: called when react has committed a fiber root and effects have run
- `onCommitFiberUnmount`: called when a fiber unmounts

## development

pre-requisite: you should understand how react works internally. if you don't, please give this [series of articles](https://jser.dev/series/react-source-code-walkthrough) a read.

we use a pnpm monorepo, get started by running:

```shell
pnpm install
# create dev builds
pnpm run dev
# run unit tests
pnpm run test
```

you can ad-hoc test by running `pnpm run dev` in the `/kitchen-sink` directory.

```shell
cd kitchen-sink
pnpm run dev
```

## misc

we use this project internally in [react-scan](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan), which is deployed with proper safeguards to ensure it's only used in development or error-guarded in production.

while i maintain this specifically for react-scan, those seeking more robust solutions might consider [its-fine](https://github.com/pmndrs/its-fine) for accessing fibers within react using hooks, or [react-devtools-inline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-devtools-inline) for a headful interface.

if you plan to use this project beyond experimentation, please review [react-scan's source code](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan) to understand our safeguarding practices.
